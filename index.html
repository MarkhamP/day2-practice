        <h3>Don't let anyone push design on you without some knowledge of the platform. All too often you end up explaining why the design won't fly in this airspace. Feelings get hurt, confidence is lost, and team cohesion is stretched. "Anything is possible" takes a backseat to "My way or the Highway". Keep the faith; anything is indeed possible, the code will lead the way, so learn the code's quirks and frustrations. Along the way, you just might cherish those who challenge your abilities with less than desirable design.</h3>
